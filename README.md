# UFOs 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a UFO sightings webpage which can provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This HTML page will pull information from a javascript file, and user can use filters to have a quick access to find UFO sightings information based on the different locations and different shapes.

## Results
Once users enter the webpage, they will be welcomed with a brief introduction.

As the users continue to scroll down, they will see all the UFO sightings information and the filters that can help them to easily find the information they are looking for. There are five filters, users can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape. Users can enter any of these filters to search for the information or they can enter all the filters at the same time to search for the specific information. After they enter the filters, the website will present all the sightings information based on users' search.

This webpage is convenient for users to inspect specific data.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that this webpage is missing a search button, which could make the user confused about whether the webpage is helping them extract specific data from the whole data or not.

Recommendations for futher development:
1. Each search bar can display a drop-down menu to tell users what options are available in each search bar.
2.
